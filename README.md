Hello!

This is my output for the HTML Foundations project. The Odin Recipes page contains these three recipe pages:
- Midwest Salisbury Steak
- Vietnamese Spring Rolls
- Filipino Beef Stir Fry

This project puts my knowledge about HTML boilerplate, elements, tags, attributes, lists, and images to test. This also lets me practice how to write good commit messages and organize my files better. Feel free to provide constructive criticisms and tips on how I can write the codes better.
